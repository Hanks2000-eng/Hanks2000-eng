- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hanks2000-eng
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, Python and Java, tennis, dogs and all things nerdy. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above, in the hopes of leaving my crappy office job behind. 
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on anything beginner-friendly to help me learn the ropes.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also a wannabe writer.
